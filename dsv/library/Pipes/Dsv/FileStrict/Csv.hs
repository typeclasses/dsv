{- | Often, the first line of a CSV file is a row that gives the name of each column in the file. If present, this row is called the /header/.

=== Example

CSV file:

> Date,Vendor,Price,Notes
> 2019-03-24,Acme Co,$599.89,Dehydrated boulders
> 2019-04-18,Acme Co,$24.95,Earthquake pills

Result:

> ( AttoComplete,
>   [ [ Labeled "Date"   "2019-03-24",
>       Labeled "Vendor" "Acme Co",
>       Labeled "Price"  "$599.89",
>       Labeled "Notes"  "Dehydrated boulders" ],
>     [ Labeled "Date"   "2019-04-18",
>       Labeled "Vendor" "Acme Co",
>       Labeled "Price"  "$24.95",
>       Labeled "Notes"  "Earthquake pills" ] ] )

{- | Not every CSV file has a header row. Use this function to read a CSV file that does /not/ have a header.

=== Example

CSV file:

> 2019-03-24,Acme Co,$599.89,Dehydrated boulders
> 2019-04-18,Acme Co,$24.95,Earthquake pills

Result:

> ( AttoComplete,
>   [ ["2019-03-24", "Acme Co", "$599.89", "Dehydrated boulders"],
>     ["2019-04-18", "Acme Co", "$24.95",  "Earthquake pills"] ] )

readCsvFileStrictWithoutHeader fp = readDsvFileStrictWithoutHeader comma fp

{- | Sometimes a CSV file has a header but you don't care about it. In that case, you can use this function to /ignore/ the header line and read only the rows containing data.

=== Example

CSV file:

> Date,Vendor,Price,Notes
> 2019-03-24,Acme Co,$599.89,Dehydrated boulders
> 2019-04-18,Acme Co,$24.95,Earthquake pills

Result:

> ( AttoComplete,
>   [ ["2019-03-24", "Acme Co", "$599.89", "Dehydrated boulders"],
>     ["2019-04-18", "Acme Co", "$24.95",  "Earthquake pills"] ] )
